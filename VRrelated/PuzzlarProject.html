		<div class="content">
			<p>This is a puzzler project with magic ambience. In this game, you will be invited to a chamber, which is full of medieval and magical atmosphere. Without addressing the puzzler, you won’t be able to get out. The puzzler is simple. There will be 5 balls in the chamber lighted up in certain sequence after you getting in. What you have to do is to remember the sequence, and redo it. Sounds as hints will help you to address it. I hope the player enjoys this puzzler.</p>

		</div>
		<h5 class="title_3">User test 1(Feedbacks)</h5>
		<div class="content">
			<p>1. It looks like in a mid-century castle with a historic feeling. The environment is quiet and with the lights down I feel comfortable. It stimulates me to explore this chamber and find something interesting. I get more and more excited! </p>
			<p>2. The height of me is a little bit weird, it seems that I only a little taller than the barrels. I think I should be taller? Unless I am a child or a Gnome :P/laughing/</p>
			<p>3. Both of the two panels are quite close to my face, I feel I can almost hit them.</p>
		</div>

		</div>
		<h5 class="title_3">User test 2(Feedbacks)</h5>

		</div>
